# Common Test Metrics 

<u>Test Coverage :</u> 
Definition: The percentage of test cases executed versus the total number of test cases.
Formula: (Number of test cases executed / Total number of test cases) * 100
---
 
<u>Defect Density :</u> 
Definition: The number of defects identified per unit size of the software (e.g., per thousand lines of code).
Formula: Number of defects / Size of the software

 
<u>Defect Distribution :</u> 
Definition: The distribution of defects across different modules or components of the software.
Formula: (Number of defects in a module / Total number of defects) * 100


<u>Test Execution Status :</u> 
Definition: The status of test cases (e.g., passed, failed, blocked).
Formula: Number of test cases in a status / Total number of test cases


<u>Defect Severity Index :</u>
Definition: A measure of the severity of defects found.
Formula: (Sum of all defect severities) / Total number of defects


<u>Test Case Efficiency :</u>
Definition: The percentage of test cases that resulted in finding defects.
Formula: (Number of defects found / Number of test cases executed) * 100


<u>Defect Rejection Rate :</u>
Definition: The percentage of defects reported that are considered invalid or duplicates.
Formula: (Number of rejected defects / Total number of defects reported) * 100

 
<u>Defect Resolution Time :</u>
Definition: The average time taken to resolve defects.
Formula: Sum of all defect resolution times / Total number of defects resolved


<u>Test Execution Productivity :</u>
Definition: The number of test cases executed per unit time.
Formula: Number of test cases executed / Total testing time

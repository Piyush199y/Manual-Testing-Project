# Common Test Metrics 

Test Coverage : 
Definition: The percentage of test cases executed versus the total number of test cases.
Formula: (Number of test cases executed / Total number of test cases) * 100

Defect Density : 
Definition: The number of defects identified per unit size of the software (e.g., per thousand lines of code).
Formula: Number of defects / Size of the software

Defect Distribution : 
Definition: The distribution of defects across different modules or components of the software.
Formula: (Number of defects in a module / Total number of defects) * 100

Test Execution Status : 
Definition: The status of test cases (e.g., passed, failed, blocked).
Formula: Number of test cases in a status / Total number of test cases

Defect Severity Index : 
Definition: A measure of the severity of defects found.
Formula: (Sum of all defect severities) / Total number of defects

Test Case Efficiency : 
Definition: The percentage of test cases that resulted in finding defects.
Formula: (Number of defects found / Number of test cases executed) * 100

Defect Rejection Rate : 
Definition: The percentage of defects reported that are considered invalid or duplicates.
Formula: (Number of rejected defects / Total number of defects reported) * 100

Defect Resolution Time : 
Definition: The average time taken to resolve defects.
Formula: Sum of all defect resolution times / Total number of defects resolved

Test Execution Productivity : 
Definition: The number of test cases executed per unit time.
Formula: Number of test cases executed / Total testing time
